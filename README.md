# RollRaceDemo
A 3D game made entirely by me in three months using Unity3D and C# more then three years ago

This project is far from being perfect but it required me a lot of effort to complete. It let me  learn to better design an overall system, to find creative ways to create different dynamics and to take all the various peaces and subsystems together. Even if it didn't take a large amount of code, it required methocidity and computational thinking in a time I didn't know the modern best practices and methodologies. Still it is a completed project I am proud of, quite complex and appealing, with overall reasonable design choices.

# How to run
This demo is both compatible with windows and linux. Just run either the .lnk (Windows) or the the symbolic link(Linux) file in the main directory.
